This project focuses on extracting and analyzing text from research papers in PDF format. We will use Grobid, an open-source tool designed for structured text extraction, 
to process academic documents and extract meaningful information.

Objetives:
- Set up a repository for project deliverables.
- Use Grobid to extract text from research papers.
- Analyze the extracted text for patterns, key topics, and insights.
- Build a structured dataset for further processing.

To run the scripts, remember:

- Have the script and the XML to analyze in the same directory, or provide the full path of the .xml file to analyze.
- Insert the .xml generated by Grobid in the line: with open('Name of the XML to insert', 'r') as xml_file:
      with open('Nombre del XML a introducir', 'r') as xml_file:
